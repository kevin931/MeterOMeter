# MeterOMeter

Welcome to the Meter-O-Meter Project!!

## About:

The Meter-O-Meter project is based on www.meter-o-meter.com and Tim Cassedy's idea of measuring metrical density and identifying metrical verse in prose and poetry. While determining the meter of one single poem may not be hard, finding patterns and statistics on a larger scale is difficult. This project, alongside with all the implementations on www.meter-o-meter.com, is such an attempt that provides a path for researchers to study metrical verse from a computational point of view.

The MeterOMeter package provides only limited functions at this time. The meter_yaml function currently relies on a proprietary meter-o-meter YAML format that is not yet available to the general public, but all other functions serve as stand-alone functions for R.

## Current Version:

0.1.1

## What's New?

Standardizing future versions. Starting from this version, the master will stay unchanged with each version. The version system will go according to convention.

For updates in older versions, please [click here](https://github.com/kevin931/MeterOMeter/blob/master/Versions.md).

## Current Status:

This project is periodically maintained with new features planned.

## Known Issues:

1. There currently is no documentation for this package whatsoever, and I will address this issue in the near future.

2. The num_to_speech function covers only a certain range of numbers at this time.

## Collaboration:

This project is currently part of a research effort addressing metrical qualities of the English language, and I am planning on making this package a more general NLP package in the near future. Anyone is welcome to make a pull request and contribute in any way that he/she sees fit.
